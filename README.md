# 4Comply Reference Implementation

### This document and code repository aims to serve as a sample implementation for the 4Comply API.

A real world application may have many other systems integrated, but it will likely use the same few API calls to the 4Comply API, which we have implemented here.

This sample app is written in Javascript (Node.js + Express)
